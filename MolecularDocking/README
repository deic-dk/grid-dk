			THE GRID DOCKER 

	Molecular docking on grid using the Molegro Virtual Docker


SETTING miguser.conf:
To use the grid docker you need be able to access either the MiG or Grid.dk server via the downloadable user script. 
For this you need to set the miguser.conf file. 

This is a template: 

migserver GRID_SERVER
certfile /home/LOGIN/.globus/cert.crt
keyfile /home/LOGIN/.globus/key.pem
cacertfile /home/LOGIN/.globus/trusted_CA.crt

If your key was generated using a pass phrase add the line :
password PASSPHRASE


1. CONFIGURATION
Edit the configuration file dockingConfig.py to customize the docking procedure. The most important fields include:

protein_file - path to protein file 
ligands_file - path to ligand file
num_ligands - number of ligands in the ligand file
runs - number of runs per ligand. Since a randomize searched algorithm is used. Each run may produce different results.
jobsize - number of job units. One job unit consists of 1 ligand, run 1 time. Ex.: 3 ligands, run twice creates 6 job units. A job size of 3 thus creates 2 jobs.



2. USAGE
Run the grid docking application by typing:	
	python grid_docker.py <options>
options: -help for help
	 -l    for local execution (requires MVD installed locally)


3. VIEWING RESULTS
After a run the results are gathered in the file dockingresults/DockingResults_main.mvdresults. 
This file can be opened if you have MVD installed locally. Note that this file references the *.mol2 files 
that contain the actual molecule visualisation information. 

When opening the result file MVD ask you to choose which ligand poses you wish to import. Choose the which ones to view and continue. 
If you wish to see the ligand relative to the target protein (Ex.: target.mvdml) please import the file manually. Then remove click in the left
menu to add/remove the components from the view.


4. REMARKS
If you do not have the Molegro Virtual Docker software installed on the grid resources you can 
embed the the software in the jobs. To do this please copy the main molegro folder into the 
MolecularDocking dir, so the paths fit the MVD paths in dockingConfig. Then disable the 
use_mvd_RTE variable.


5. REQUIREMENTS:
- Python (tested using v2.5)
- Access to Grid.dk or Minimum intrusion Grid. e.i.: ".globus/" or ".mig/" folder with grid.dk or MiG certs respectively.
- The Molegro Virtual Docker (either as purchased, locally-installed software or as a grid runtime environment)
- Curl
