GRID::DK was a research project, 2009-2011, funded by the Danish Center for Scientific Computing (DCSC) - with the aim of providing
researchers at Danish universities with uniform access to the so-called "free" or "sandbox" resources of the DCSC computer centers.
The free resources amount to ~10% of the total computing and storage resources at each center.
