# GUI use cases

# Examples of more complicated jobs/productions using the {{{GridPilot}}} GUI

This section presents detailed examples of how grid.dk computing and storage resources can be  used with the {{{GridPilot}}} graphical user interface. These examples are from real research projects, one of which was supported by grid.dk and the eScience center at the University of Copenhagen (Niels Bohr Institute). Users are encouraged to study the examples to learn to develop their own {{{GridPilot}}} grid applications.

Documentation, including an introduction to {{{GridPilot}}}, [can be found on the GridPilot web site](http://www.gridfactory.org/documentation/#User_guides).
