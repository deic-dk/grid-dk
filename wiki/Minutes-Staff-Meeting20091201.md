## New Menu Structure for Web

We briefly talked about the example page showing the new menu structure, and essentially the VO page features. 

This new structure will not be implemented for the demo, but afterwards.

For the demo, the statistics page will be a (temporary) link on the old VGrid page. Later, statistics will be filtered by VO membership, including access restrictions.
