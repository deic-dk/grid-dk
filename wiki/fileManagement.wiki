#summary The file manager of the portal

= File management =
The users home directory is found under <a href="https://portal.grid.dk/cgi-bin/fileman.py">Files</a>. Files are shown as a traditional folder tree containing files and folder icons. For standard file operations the user can right-click on a given file icon and choose from the popup menu. 


For instance, to create a custom folder: Right-click on the destination folder icon (labelled "myfolder") and then select "Create Folder". To upload a file, the same right-click menu is used, but instead select "Upload File".

The right-click options are slightly different for files and folders. File options include "Download", which downloads the file to local disk and "Submit job". The "Submit job" option is intended for submitting .mRSL files directly.

= Attaching local storage =

If your local system administrator is serving file with an https file server, you can attach a directory from this server as "grid_home" and manage it with the file manager of the portal. Your system administrator can take a look at [http://grid.dk/#2 grid.dk] to see how to do this.
