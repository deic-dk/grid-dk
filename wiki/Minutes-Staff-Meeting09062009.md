# Staff meeting 9/6-2009

Minutes by Jonas

Benjamin

 - couldn't attend due to hospital appointment
 - detailed status available in mail
 - working on confusa installation on grid.dk server
 - started installing lunarc
 - will continue with those tasks and MiG install on grid.dk server

Jost

 - Attended SGAS meeting
  - SGAS internal database to be changed, but remains XML-based
  - we could not obtain a spec for minimum usage record information
  - a new "reporting module" has been kicked off in conjunction with the database change (not graphics, but only stat.s)
  - Jost will work on the grid.dk specifics in this module
 - SGAS as such does not look like a shrink wrapped solution for us. We will investigate an alternative path: extract ARC user records from SGAS, merge with MiG URs and insert in relational DB used to generate our own stats and graphics.
 - Added UR support to MiG so that same URs are written for MiG jobs
 - Investigates arc-backend (web)

Frederik

 - Investigate solution for distributed home dirs (https/VOs/gacl/...)
 - will migrate to google code wiki
 - will create jonas on grid.dk - delete old wiki accounts?

Jonas

 - check RTE task deadline and prioritize as necessary
 - help Jost with MiG install on grid.dk
 - add simple submit page with individual fields (input file dialog?)
 - add simple file explorer page with two pane layout
 - add Jost as owner on aalborg resource(s) for grid.dk conf copy
