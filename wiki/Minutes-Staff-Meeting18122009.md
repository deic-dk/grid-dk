# Staff meeting 18/12-2009

Minutes by Jonas


Status and planning meeting at NBI.

Attending: Frederik, Jost, Benjamin, Jonas


## Summary of demo/review

Frederik summarized the board review/demo and showed his presentation.

Focus on a new motivation: supercomputing for the masses.

Frederik didn't have time for showing SSO but quickly showed new
graphical stats, sw repo and molegro grid application run with sw repo
backend.

The was a discussion about balance between deployment and development
with the board in relation to the original project grant. Available
components are not ready for deployment, so it requires some development
work to get to that point.

There may be further negotiation about the grant and goals, but that
will probably take place between board and Brian.


## Grid.dk branding

We talked about official 'branding' in the web interface in relation to
the demo. We need to preserve copyright notices and variable names, but
we can work towards replacing all displayed 'MiG' labels to be either
generic or configurable to better support project specific branding.


## WAYF status

There are still some challenges so we should expect some more work in
that area.


## Future planning

We  will focus more on getting users on Grid from now on. Jost proposed
creating demos and tutorials in addition to agitating for our solution:
Jost will start this work.

Accounting work needs to be done in Q1 of 2010, adding to the new statistics
from Jost.

Home dirs work will continue (Frederik).
