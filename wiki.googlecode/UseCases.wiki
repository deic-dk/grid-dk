#summary Scripting use cases

=Examples of more complicated jobs/productions using the grid.dk portal and the MiG Python API=
This section presents detailed examples of how grid services can be used from Python scripts. These examples are all from real research projects supported by grid.dk and the eScience center at the University of Copenhagen (Niels Bohr Institute). They can be downloaded and run locally. Users are encouraged to study the examples to learn to develop their own Python grid applications.
