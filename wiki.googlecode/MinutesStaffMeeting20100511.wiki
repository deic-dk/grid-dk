#summary Staff meeting 11/5-2010

Minutes by Frederik

Status and planning meeting at NBI.

Attending: Benjamin, Frederik, Jesper, Jost 

== Recent Activities ==

 * Jesper: is looking at improving the statistics page: better layout with more resources/users, VO view, permissions


 * Benjamin: working on job submission page: streamlining - essential fields on top, non-essential on fold-down section; same old issue: ARC button/checkbox or not - cross-grid scheduling not feasible - a checkbox it will be. Also, ARC resources should appear under selectable resources.

 * Jost: looked at 0install on ARC - awaiting response from Josva.

 * Frederik: WAYF/TCS is progressing nicely - now it's possible to login via Terena's portal - WAYF - KU, but certificates can still not be requested because of meta-data exchange issues between WAYF and Terena. WAYF is working on it.
