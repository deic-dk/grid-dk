#summary Getting started with grid.dk

= Introduction =
Grid.dk uses the http secure (https) protocol for communication between users and the grid.dk server. To access the grid.dk web portal you need to have a trusted certificate imported in your browser.

= Getting a certificate trusted by grid.dk =

 * First of all you must tell your browser to trust the grid.dk web server by clicking [http://ca.nordugrid.org/cacrt.crt here].

 * Next you need to install a certificate grid.dk trusts in your browser. There are 4 ways of doing this - the first one is preferred:
  * *Terena Certificate Service* - the easiest way: just login on the [https://tcs-escience-portal.terena.org/ Terena EScience Portal] and generate a certificate. This is currently only possible for users from Copenhagen University, but extensions are planned.
  * <font color=gray>*Nordugrid*: 1) request a certificate from the [http://ca.nordugrid.org/ NorduGrid certificate authority] (CA) by following their instructions. 2) Wait for the CA to send you a signed certificate and import the certificate in your browser. You can find help for this [http://code.google.com/p/grid-dk/wiki/CertificateHelp here].</font>
  *  <font color=gray>*grid.dk catch-all CA*: 1) request a certificate from [https://portal.grid.dk/cgi-sid/reqcert.py here]. 2) Wait for the CA to send you a signed certificate and import the certificate in your browser. You can find help for this [http://code.google.com/p/grid-dk/wiki/CertificateHelp here].</font>
  *  <font color=gray>*DANID* (obsolete). If you have a Danish "Digital Signatur", you can use this.</font>
