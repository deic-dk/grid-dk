#summary How to run a python job

= Running a Python job =

Python is a popular scripting language known for its simple syntax and readability. To run a python job on grid.dk we need to upload the python file and specify that we need a python runtime environment.

=== Command ===
The file `myprog.py` contains the code we want to run. In the *Execute commands* field we write the command to execute the file.

{{{
$PYTHON myprog.py
}}}

`$PYTHON` is an environment variable on the resource that points to Python.

=== Input file ===
After uploading the python file to our home directory we write it in the *Input Files* field.

{{{
myprog.py
}}}

In the submit <a href="https://portal.grid.dk/cgi-bin/submitjob.py">job user interface</a> it would look like this.

=== Runtime Environment ===
Since we are using python we specify that we need it as runtime environment on the resource. Choose any of the available Python versions:
