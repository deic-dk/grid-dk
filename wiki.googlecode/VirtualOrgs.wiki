== Features ==
The features of a virtual organization are:
  * A shared folder in each members grid.dk home directory.
  * A web page that can only be accessed by members.
  * Access to a set of resources that the owner has added to the virtual organization.
  * A wiki page for members.

There are owners and members. The basic difference is that owners can add new members and resources to the virtual organization and edit the contents of the web page.

== Joining a virtual organization ==
To join a virtual organization a user needs to request it. This is done in the link in the *Virtual Organization request* section. An owner then decides whether to deny or grant access. 

== Creating a virtual organization ==
To create a virtual organization go to the *Create a new Virtual Organization* section. Write the name of your virtual organization and click the "Create Virtual Organization" button. The user that created it becomes an owner.
